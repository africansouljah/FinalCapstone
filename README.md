Code explaination.

The first line imports the math library so that we can use the math.pow() function later on in the code.
The next few lines print out the menu options to the user. There are two options: "Investment" and "Bond".
The code then prompts the user to choose a calculation by entering either "investment" or "bond". The input() function is used to capture the user's input and store it in the 'calculation' variable.
If the user enters "investment", the code prompts the user to enter the deposit amount, interest rate, number of years for the investment, and type of interest (simple or compound). The interest is then calculated based on the user's input, and the total amount of interest is printed out.
If the user enters "bond", the code prompts the user to enter the present house value, the annual interest rate, and the number of months until repayment. The monthly interest and repayment are then calculated based on the user's input, and the monthly repayment amount is printed out.
If the user enters something other than "investment" or "bond", the code prints out an error message.
Finally, the program stops running.
Overall, this code is a simple calculator that can help users calculate either the amount of interest earned on an investment or the amount of money required to repay a home loan.
