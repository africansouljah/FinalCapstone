# Concept of the task:

A continuation of the previous task. In this task, I will be creating a program for a small business that will help them to manage tasks assigned to each member of their team.

# Code Exaplation:

The code is a task management system that allows users to register, assign tasks to users, view tasks, and view tasks assigned to themselves.

The program starts by importing the required datetime and date libraries. It then defines some variables to store user data, the number of tasks, and the number of users. It also initializes empty lists to store user credentials such as usernames, passwords, and confirmed passwords.

The program defines four functions: reg_user, assign_task, view_tasks, and view_my_tasks.

The reg_user function prompts the user to input a new username and checks if it already exists in the user.txt file. If the username is not already in the file, the user is prompted to input a password, and the program writes the username and password to the user.txt file.

The assign_task function prompts the user to input the username of the person to whom the task is assigned, the title of the task, the task description, and the task's due date. The program then writes the details of the task to the tasks.txt file in a specific format.

The view_tasks function reads the contents of the tasks.txt file and prints out each task's details, including the task number, task name, task description, and task deadline.

The view_my_tasks function reads the contents of the tasks.txt file and displays the tasks assigned to the user who is currently logged in. The function then prompts the user to select a task to view in more detail. If the task has not been completed, the user can choose to mark the task as complete or edit the task.

# To install project, follow these steps:

First, go to the project's GitHub page.
Click on the "Code" button and then click on "Download ZIP". This will download the project as a ZIP file.
Extract the ZIP file to a location on your computer where you want to store the project.
Open a terminal or command prompt window and navigate to the project's directory.
Install any required dependencies by running the appropriate command. This will depend on the project and the programming language used.
Run the project by executing the appropriate command or running the main file.

# After downloading the project from GitHub, you can follow these steps to use it:

Open the command line or terminal and navigate to the project's directory.
Install any required dependencies by running the command npm install.
Set up the configuration file by creating a .env file and providing the necessary values for the environment variables. You can copy the .env.example file and update the values.
Start the development server by running the command npm run dev.
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

# Example of usage in real life:

This code can be used in real life to create a simple task management system for individuals or small teams. The system allows users to register, assign tasks to specific users, and view tasks.

To use this code in real life, you would need to:

Save the code to a file with a .py extension.
Install Python on your computer.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
Run the code by typing "python filename.py" in the terminal, where "filename" is the name of the file you saved the code in.
Follow the prompts to register users, assign tasks, and view tasks.
